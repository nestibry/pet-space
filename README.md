## User Story
```
AS A potential pet parent searching for the perfect pet,
I WANT to be able to search by animal type, age, size, and location.
SO THAT I can find my dream pet!
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a website I am able to search for a pet.

WHEN I enter my criteria for a pet,
THEN I want to view potential matches.

WHEN I view a pet profile,
THEN I am able to see a description of the pet and pictures of the pet.

WHEN I find matches,
THEN I am able to save them.

WHEN I find the best match,
THEN I am able to fill out a form to inquire about my pet match.

```
